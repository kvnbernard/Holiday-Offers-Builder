Whether it's a health trail or a contemplative stop, you can decide which way you want to go at the Vaipahi water gardens.
A sacred place for the inhabitants of the south coast of Tahiti, unique in Polynesia, the Vaipahi water gardens concentrate a multitude of tropical plants, both local and imported. You will appreciate the beauty of its flora as well as its magnificent landscapes where springs, streams, basins and waterfalls come together. Originally, the waters of Vaipahi were an obligatory rite of passage for the purification of the deceased souls of the Great Teva, the island's ancestral clan.
The most athletic will be able to take full advantage of this heavenly site. Three routes are available: the river trail (2 km - one hour walk), the medium loop (2.736 km - 1 hour and 15 minutes walk) and the long loop (5.125 km - two hours walk). You will walk up marked paths, cross alleys lined with Pinus trees - the Caribbean pines - and climb with the help of ropes at the steepest points to finally come down and enjoy an invigorating break in the shade of the flourishing vegetation.
