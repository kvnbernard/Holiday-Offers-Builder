Mount Orohena is the highest peak of the French island of Tahiti and of all French Polynesia. Culminating at 2,241 m, it is also the French summit with the greatest topographic isolation.
To reach the top of the mountain, it is necessary to make a hike of more than 6 hours from the town of Mahina, passing by the plateaus of Moto Fefe, Pihaaiateta and Pito Hiti which offer a view on Tahiti and the neighboring islands of the Society archipelago.
You will be able to live an unforgettable experience while observing breathtaking landscapes.
