The viewpoint is located on an agricultural estate assigned to the Rural Development Department. It is easily accessible from the town of Taravao, following the signs "Plateau de Taravao". The access road climbs up through pastures where cows are resting peacefully.
The landscapes of the Taravao Plateau resemble the countryside of Normandy or New Zealand.
The lookout offers a panoramic view of the Taravao isthmus.
A small pond filled with water lilies provides a place for horses to quench their thirst or for wild green-necked ducks to rest.
A hiking trail connects the lookout to the second viewpoint located 500 m further on, near the water retention basin that feeds the farms. The pond is also accessible by car from the road.
