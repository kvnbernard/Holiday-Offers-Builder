Fare Hape is a dense area rich in ceremonial structures, including large marae, habitat sites, paepae, terraces, an archer's platform, and notable stones, the Drum Stone (ofai Pahu), Ofai Nati (Covenant Stone), and Pere Meteorite (Opurei o Pere). To the northeast of the site, along the river, there is a large rock which shelters the Apaapauai shelter and the Apaapauai basins.
The archaeological site of Farehape, which is located about 18 kilometers from the sea, illustrates well one of the types of organization of the ancient habitat of the upper Papenoo valley.
This site is located on a vast alluvial terrace on the right bank of the Vaitu'oru River, surrounded by slopes to the south and west, extending 500 meters from east to west and having an average width of 50 meters. Its occupation has not been precisely dated, but it dates back several centuries and has actually had two periods of occupation. The first period ended at the end of the 18th century, with the arrival of the missionaries who forced the inhabitants to move to the coast. The second period of occupation saw the Mamaia sect (dissidents from Christianity) stay there for 20 years to escape the repression of the missionaries.
