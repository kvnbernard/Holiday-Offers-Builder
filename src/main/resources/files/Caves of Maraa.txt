A must-see site on the tourist's map of the island, the Maraa caves are one of the most easily accessible attractions because of their location on the roadside.
The vault of the main cave on the side of the cliff and the huge basin of water that it shelters is imprinted with a bewitching mystery. Consisting of a series of four caves of varying size, this unique site once attracted walkers in search of freshness.
It was customary to come and take a dip on the first of January on the occasion of the traditional tour of the island to mark the beginning of the new year.
