Polynesians have a special relationship with the sea, considering it as their "Mother Earth". The Polynesian marine world is indeed renowned for its great richness and diversity, which makes French Polynesia a world-renowned diving center.
However, if there is no "mother mother", it is more precisely "feeder coral" because corals are one of the first links of the food chain. Demanding by nature, corals are also a privileged indicator of the health of the marine environment: a too high temperature (ideally between 20 and 30 degrees), a too low salinity and hydrodynamism (agitation of the water ensuring a good oxygenation), a polluted environment... are as many causes of the death of corals.
The reef, built by these patient architects, shelters numerous animal and plant species. The corals also allow the birth of a closed, sheltered and shallow marine space where a new ecosystem develops: the lagoon.
