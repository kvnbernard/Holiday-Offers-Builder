A visit to the archaeological site of the Arahurahu marae, restored in 1953, gives an insight into the culture and in particular the ancestral Ma'ohi religion (Polynesian origin) before the arrival of the Europeans. This marae is typical of ancient cult centers. It is composed of a tahua (sacred courtyard), a patu (surrounding wall), a stepped ahu (altar), unu (carved wooden pieces) of red color, anthropomorphic or zoomorphic representations dedicated to the t√¢ura (guardian spirits), 'ofa'i tuturiraa (support stone) and fata 'ai'ai (wooden offering platforms), where food destined for the gods was presented.
The setting, calm and natural beauty of the Tefa'aiti Valley provides a green setting that calls for respect for the place. At the entrance, visitors are greeted by two Ti'i or Tiki, (anthropomorphic sculptures in stone or wood).
The archaeological site of the Arahurahu marae is a witness that links the Polynesian land to its past. The approach to such a site must therefore be done with respect for Polynesian traditions.
