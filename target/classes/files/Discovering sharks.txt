Many varieties of sharks can be found in Polynesian waters, living in lagoons or in the open sea: the powerful grey shark, tapered and able to reach 2m, abounds near passes and drop-offs.
The lemon shark, slightly yellowish in color and measuring up to 3m, evolves near the bottom including in lagoons.
The black-finned and white-finned sharks, much smaller, are mostly found in the passes and in the lagoon.
More imposing sharks living in the open sea such as the tiger shark, hammerhead shark and sleeper shark can be observed during dives in the sea.
