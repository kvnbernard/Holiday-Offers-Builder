This amazing site is located right next to the Faarumai waterfalls. 
It is a natural hole dug in the rock and which emits a powerful blow caused by the waves. The stronger the waves are, the more impressive the blast is. The site also offers a beautiful view of the ocean and its surfers.
Anahoho Cave, better known as the "Blower's Hole", is a historic site that has long served as a stopover for Polynesian families touring the island. At the time, there was a road to visit it, the Arahoho, which means "howling road". Today, this road no longer exists but has been replaced by a fully equipped passage for tourists.
Tourists can now safely visit the Blower's Hole. It is said that it is from this cave that the warriors of Tiarei threw the lifeless bodies of their enemies, the warriors of Papenoo. But what impresses the visitors today remains the noisy and often impressive breath which emerges from it.
This sea geyser or more exactly this underwater cave is prolonged by a chimney, an ancient lavatube formed several million years ago by the passage of a lava flow in the current basaltic cliffs. As a result, when the waves rush into the underwater cave, they cause a geyser to gush out through this hole which, depending on the power of the wave, causes a spectacular blast. In the last few days, the strong north swell that hit the east coast of Tahiti offered an impressive spectacle for onlookers and was a treat for surfers.
