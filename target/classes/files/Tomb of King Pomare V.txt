In the commune of Arue, at km 4.7 at 'Outu'ai'ai point, there is a monument that is far from common, the "tomb of King Pomare V". The latter had the remains of his mother Pomare IV moved to be buried there. The queen's tomb became the king's tomb. This place is full of stories and represents an important part of Tahitian culture.
With its imposing shape, pyramidal and rectangular at its base, the famous tomb of the king impresses. The walls of the building are entirely made of coral blocks welded together with cement. But the most surprising thing is that this construction is surmounted by a kind of amphora or urn. Some people even go so far as to say that it would be the shape of a bottle of absinthe. Indeed, we know that the king was particularly fond of this drink which he considered as a nectar. He died of alcoholism at the royal palace in Papeete on June 12, 1891.
