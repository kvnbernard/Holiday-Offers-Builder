The humpback whale, which can measure up to 16m and weigh up to 35 tons, feeds exclusively on krill and small fish that abound in the cold waters of the poles.
But in order to avoid the rigors of the southern winter, Antarctic humpback whales migrate to the more temperate waters of Polynesia to give birth and reproduce. Thus, from July/August, mothers and their calves can be observed along the reefs in the Austral archipelago and around Moorea.
During the whole nursing period, which lasts about 5 months, the mothers do not feed but feed their calves with a very rich milk that allows them to grow very quickly and to face the long journey that will bring them back to their feeding place, towards the end of October.
