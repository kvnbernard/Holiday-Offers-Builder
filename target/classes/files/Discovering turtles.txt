Two species of turtles live in Polynesian waters: the green turtle which can measure up to 1.50m and weigh up to 230kg, and the hawksbill turtle of more modest size (maximum 90cm for 50kg).
Unfortunately, these two species are threatened with extinction due to pollution and poaching, despite the Washington decree and territorial regulations prohibiting their hunting. The ancient Polynesians already appreciated its meat, which was reserved for the elite of society.
